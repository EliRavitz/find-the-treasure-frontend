About this game:

Remember that “find the treasure game” we used to play as kids? 
When we hid clues and let our friends follow the arrows toward the hidden 2-dollar prize? 
Well, welcome back to childhood 🥳
This game is all about this childhood nostalgy, but much better😊
Our game allows you to build your own find-the-treasure game, 
wherever you want – whether in your neighborhood or somewhere else around the globe. 
It’s a very small world… and you are the boss😉
You can play with your friends or family, build your own game path, plant your clues along the way and let them all go wild 😉 

Feel it yourself:

In order to enter the game manager's area without registration, 
I put a button on the home page on the top right "Free passage for visitors" that allows free entry. 
Inside this user there is a ready-made game called " game 1- do not delete " which gives the possibility to see a ready-made game, 
please do not change it, but you can set up as many additional games as you want :)

Good to know:

Some technical drilldown
1. We used Leaflet for geo location and map.
Their technology calculate location by GPS and your IP address - in case GPS signal is not clear enough. 
As you know, IP address location tends to be not accurate enough, so if you experience any issue with your
accurate location – it means you’re inside doors or your GPS is not turned on.
Don’t worry though – your players will get the accurate location once they are playing outside with GPS on.

2. Different cell phones send their location differently (especially iPhone)
so there can be problems sometimes when building a game / trying to play a game through mobile devices.
This bug will be fixed later.
Therefore, in the meantime, to ensure smooth operation, it is recommended to use the website via a computer.
